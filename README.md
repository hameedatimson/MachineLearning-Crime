# MachineLearning-Crime


Before getting started with this project, confirm that Jupyter Notebook is properly installed on your machine; alternatively, follow the official installation documentation as needed for guidance.

Once set up is complete, download our specific .ipynb file version into any directory that you prefer using 'git clone . Access this folder through Terminal via its directory pathway.

Begin running notebooks by opening Terminal and calling up Jupyter and reading through the corresponding website displayed via browser upon startup confirmation (use the Jupyter starting prompt entered into Terminal as the designated link, "jupyter notebook uk_crime_trends_2023.ipynb").

On said browser platform, use the provided gateway page navigation tool or manually make a way to access the desired project folder in order to select and open Jupyter Notebook as saved within the file destination.

This notebook consists of various text and code cells, which work together systematically. Simply click a cell to select it before running the code through either Shift + Enter or the interface toolbar located at the top of the web page.

Execute all cells in the derived numerical order for a successful project outcome.
